Color coded map shows state wide unemployment rates first calculating country level labor force by combining unemployment rate and employed population.
Then sum up county level labor force to get state level figure.

The stacked bar chart shows the percentage of the labor force in the agriculture sector being low in states like New York and California.
For stacked bar chart I visually depicted sector wide employment differences in each state using sector employment percentages (Production, Professional, Office, Service and Construction)
Aggregate these figures to find total employment in each sector for each state.
Use labor force variable to calculate percentage of employment in each sector for each state.
